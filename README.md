### Markdown is a way to style text on the web.
#### You control the display of the document; 
#### formatting words as bold or italic, 
#### adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 
#### Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### Files with the .md or .markdown extension

##### SYNTAX
 # Headers
# This is an  h1 tag
## This is an h2 tag
### This is an h3 tag
#### This is an h4 tag
##### This is an h5 tag
###### This is an h6  tag

# Blockquotes
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.


# Inline code
 I think you should use an
 `<addr>` element here instead.
 

# Hereâ€™s an example of Python code with syntax highlighting:
``` python
 def foo():
      if not bar:
          return True
 ```
 
 ```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
 # Task Lists
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item


# Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column



# Automatic linking for URLs
Any URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.

 # Strikethrough
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

# Emoji
GitHub supports emoji!
